Below is the description of the competition and the link to the main page if you want to check it for yourself.

## Competition Description
The Digit Recognizer competition is a classic machine learning task to recognize handwritten digits. This notebook will guide you through the process of building a predictive model that identifies digits from images.

This competition is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview).

## Introduction
The Digit Recognizer dataset is a collection of handwritten digits widely used in machine learning. This notebook aims to develop a model that accurately identifies digits based on pixel values.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of two files:
- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing images of digits and their corresponding labels
- **test.csv**: The test dataset for which predictions need to be made

### Data Dictionary
- **pixel0** to **pixel783**: Pixel values (0 to 255) representing the grayscale intensity of the digit image
- **label**: The digit (0-9) corresponding to the image

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we will explore the dataset to understand the distribution of pixel values and visualize relationships between features.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Normalizing pixel values
- Reshaping data for modeling
- Handling missing or corrupted images (if any)
- Encoding categorical variables (if any)

## Modeling
We will build a neural network model to predict the digit from images. Models to consider include:
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be used to assess the performance of the models. Cross-validation will be employed to validate the robustness of the models.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings from EDA, preprocessing, and modeling sections. Discuss the performance of different models and suggest potential improvements.
